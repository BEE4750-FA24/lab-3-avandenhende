    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will write and solve a resource allocation example\n",
    "using `JuMP.jl`. `JuMP.jl` provides an intuitive syntax for writing,\n",
    "solving, and querying optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "`JuMP` requires the loading of a solver. \\[Each supported solver works\n",
    "for certain classes of problems, and some are open source while others\n",
    "require a commercial license\\]. We will use the `HiGHS` solver, which is\n",
    "open source and works for linear, mixed integer linear, and quadratic\n",
    "programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will walk through the steps involved in coding a linear\n",
    "program in HiGHS, solving it, and querying the solution.\n",

    "## Exercise (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to decide how much lumber to produce to maximize profit\n",

    "At the lumber mill, wood can be turned into plywood of various grades\n",

    "wood of each type is required for and the revenue from each grade). Any\n",

    "Table 1: Wood inputs and revenue by plywood grade. S refers to spruce\n",
    "inputs, F fir inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to identify our decision variables. While there are\n",
    "several options, we will use $G_i$, the amount of each grade the mill\n",
    "produces (in 1000 bf).\n",

    "> **JuMP Syntax**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The core pieces of setting up a `JuMP` model involve specifying the\n",
    "> model and adding variables, the objective, and constraints. At the\n",
    "> most simple level, this syntax looks like this:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> m = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)\n",
    "> @variable(m, lb <= x <= ub) # if you do not have upper or lower bounds, you can drop those accordingly\n",
    "> @variable(m, lb <= y <= ub)\n",
    "> @objective(m, Max, 100x + 250y) # replace Max with Min depending on the problem\n",
    "> @constraint(m, label, 6x + 12y <= 80) # replace \"label\" with some meaningful string you would like to use later to query shadow prices, or drop it\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can add more constraints or more variables as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Using Array Syntax**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can set up multiple variables or constraints at once using array\n",
    "> syntax. For example, the following are equivalent:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> @variable(m, G1 >= 0)\n",
    "> @variable(m, G2 >= 0)\n",
    "> @variable(m, G3 >= 0)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> and\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> @variable(m, G[1:3] >= 0)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can also set up multiple constraints using arrays of coefficients\n",
    "> and/or bounds. For example:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ``` julia\n",
    "> I = 1:3\n",
    "> d = [0; 3; 5]\n",
    "> @constraint(m, demand[i in I], G[i] >= d[i])\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "`JuMP` is finicky about changing objects and constraints, so I recommend\n",
    "setting up all of the model syntax in one notebook cell, which is what\n",
    "we will do here."
